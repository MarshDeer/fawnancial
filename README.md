# Fawnancial
Dead simple web app using vanilla Javascript to display financial tickers (
stock, cryptocurrencies) using the Finnhub API. Designed to have next to no
dependencies so that it can be run locally on any modern web browser.

use Github Pages for a demo deployment. Expect no further development unless
required by the original client.
